# Pybox - 100
My favorite category of challenges is python sandbox escapes, so while this challenge was not terribly difficult it was as always fun.
If you've read my MCCC1 walkthroughs, you know already know about the most basic methods of python sandbox escapes, and fortunately the smae solution there works here.

This looks very similar to the python sandbox escape from MCCC1, it tries to delete the builtins but does not go deep enough to truly remove the objects.
We also are allowed one exec statement like last time. Let's see if the previous solution from [here](https://github.com/Jhayes97/MCCC1-Walkthrough/blob/master/Exploitation/Sandbox%20-%20200.md) works the same.

Perfect! A little bit of foreknowledge was the key to this challenge. If you're curious about how this works please check out the `Sandbox` challenge on my [MCCC1 walkthrough](https://github.com/Jhayes97/MCCC1-Walkthrough/blob/master/Exploitation/Sandbox%20-%20200.md)
